# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
We all have suffered from the agonizing proces of trying to decide what to make for dinner! Fear not, I built an app that 
will give you random "Side", "Main" and "Dessert" dishes (no thinking required)! Additionally, the user will be able to 
add a new dish recipe to be added to the randomizer!

### Learning Goals:
- Gain knowledge and experience building an app from scratch utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Matching a provided comp using HTML and CSS.
- Interacting with User Input Data.
- Individualizing my programming skill set.

### Wins + Challenges:
## Wins
- A major win of mine was being able to capture which radio button was selected and then displaying the appropriate output.
- Another huge win is gaining comfort and experience utilizing CSS for styling and HTML to organize my content.

## Challenges
- This was my first time writing my own HTML, so writing my first few lines of HTML were the most challenging. Once I started adding the bulk of the content I started to really understand the different tags and their purposes.
